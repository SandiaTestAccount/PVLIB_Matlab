%   [TrkrTheta, AOI, SurfTilt, SurfAz]= pvl_singleaxis(SunZen, SunAz, Latitude, AxisTilt, AxisAzimuth, MaxAngle, Backtrack, GCR)
% 
% Description
%   Determine the rotation angle of a single axis tracker using the
%   equations in [1] when given a particular sun zenith and azimuth angle.
%   Backtracking may be specified, and if so, a ground coverage ratio is 
%   required.
%
%   Rotation angle is determined in a panel-oriented coordinate system.
%   The tracker azimuth AxisAzimuth defines the positive y-axis; the positive
%   x-axis is 90 degress clockwise from the y-axis and parallel to the
%   earth surface, and the positive z-axis is normal and oriented towards the sun.
%   Rotation angle TrkrTheta indicates tracker position relative to horizontal:
%   TrkrTheta = 0 is horizontal, and positive TrkrTheta is a clockwise rotation
%   around the y axis in the x, y, z coordinate system.  For example, if tracker azimuth 
%   AxisAzimuth is 180 (oriented south), TrkrTheta = 30 is a rotation of 
%   30 degrees towards the west, and TrkrTheta = -90 is a rotation to the 
%   vertical plane facing east.
% 
% Inputs:
%   SunZen - a scalar or vector of apparent (refraction-corrected) zenith
%     angles in decimal degrees. If SunZen is a vector it must be of the
%     same size as all other vector inputs. SunZen must be >=0 and <=180.
%   SunAz - a scalar or vector of sun azimuth angles in decimal degrees.
%     If SunAz is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SunAz must be >=0 and <=360. The Azimuth convention is defined
%     as degrees East of North (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, West = 270).
%   Latitude - a scalar value denoting which hempisphere the tracker is
%     in. The exact latitude is NOT required, any positive number denotes
%     the northern hemisphere, any negative number denotes the southern
%     hemisphere, a value of 0 is assumed to be northern hemisphere.
%   AxisTilt - a scalar value denoting the tilt of the axis of rotation
%     (i.e, the y-axis defined by AxisAzimuth) with respect to horizontal, 
%     in decimal degrees. AxisTilt must be >=0 and <=180.
%   AxisAzimuth - a scalar value denoting the compass direction along which
%     the axis of rotation lies, in decimal degrees. Again, the convention 
%     is defined as degrees East of North (e.g. North = 0, East = 90, 
%     West = 270). AxisAzimuth must be >=0 and <=360.
%   MaxAngle - a scalar value denoting the maximum rotation angle, in
%     decimal degrees, of the one-axis tracker from its horizontal position
%     (horizontal if AxisTilt = 0). MaxAngle must be <=180 and >=0. A
%     MaxAngle of 90 degrees allows the tracker to rotate to a vertical
%     position to point the panel towards a horizon.  
%     MaxAngle of 180 degrees allows for full rotation.
%   Backtrack - a scalar value denoting whether the tracker has the
%     capability to "backtrack" to avoid row-to-row shading. A value of 0
%     denotes no backtrack capability. Any other value denotes backtrack
%     capability. If Backtrack is not provided, the default value is 0 (no
%     backtrack).
%   GCR - a scalar value denoting the ground coverage ratio of a tracker
%     system which utilizes backtracking; i.e. the ratio between the PV
%     array surface area to total ground area. A tracker system with modules 2
%     meters wide, centered on the tracking axis, with 6 meters between the
%     tracking axes has a GCR of 2/6=0.333. If GCR is not provided, a GCR
%     of 2/7 is default. GCR must be <=1.
% 
% Output:
%   TrkrTheta - The rotation angle (Theta) of the tracker.  
%     TrkrTheta = 0 is horizontal, and positive rotation angles are
%     clockwise.
%   AOI - The angle-of-incidence of direct irradiance onto the
%     rotated panel surface.
%   SurfTilt - The angle between the panel surface and the earth
%     surface, accounting for panel rotation.
%   SurfAz - The azimuth of the rotated panel, determined by 
%     projecting the vector normal to the panel's surface to the earth's
%     surface.

% Equations in [1] assume solar azimuth is relative to reference vector

% translate input array tilt angle axistilt to [1] coordinate system.  In 
% [1] coordinates, axistilt is a rotation about the x-axis.  For a system 
% with array azimuth (y-axis) oriented south, the x-axis is oriented west,
% and a positive axistilt is a counterclockwise rotation, i.e, lifting the 
% north edge of the panel.  Thus, in [1] coordinate system, in the northern 
% hemisphere a positive axistilt indicates a rotation toward the equator, 
% whereas in the southern hemisphere rotation toward the equator is 
% indicated by axistilt<0.  Here, the input axistilt is always positive and
% is a rotation toward the equator.

% horizontal.  Here, our convention is that a clockwise rotation is 
% positive, to view rotation angles in the same frame of reference as 
% azimuth.  For example, for a system with tracking axis oriented south, 
% a rotation toward the east is negative, and a rotation to the west is
