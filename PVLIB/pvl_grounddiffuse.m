function GR = pvl_grounddiffuse(SurfTilt,GHI,Albedo)
% PVL_GROUNDDIFFUSE Estimate diffuse irradiance from ground reflections given irradiance, albedo, and surface tilt 
%
% Syntax
%   GR = pvl_grounddiffuse(SurfTilt, GHI, Albedo)
%
% Description
%   Function to determine the portion of irradiance on a tilted surface due
%   to ground reflections. Any of the inputs may be vectors or scalars, 
%   as long as all vectors are of the same size.
%
% Inputs
%   SurfTilt - a scalar or vector of surface tilt angles in decimal degrees. 
%     If SurfTilt is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector
%     inputs. SurfTilt must be >=0 and <=180. The tilt angle is defined as
%     degrees from horizontal (e.g. surface facing up = 0, surface facing
%     horizon = 90).
%   GHI - a scalar or vector of global horizontal irradiance in W/m^2. If GHI
%     is a vector it must be of the same size as all other vector inputs. 
%     GHI must be >=0.
%   Albedo - a scalar or vector for ground reflectance, typically 0.1-0.4 for
%     surfaces on Earth (land), may increase over snow, ice, etc. May also 
%     be known as the reflection coefficient. If Albedo is a vector it must
%     be of the same size as all other vector inputs. Must be >=0 and <=1.
%
% Outputs
%   GR is a column vector of ground reflected irradiances in W/m^2. 
%   The vector has the same number of elements as the input vector(s).
